# CollectorVision Web Scanner

Browser-only scanner scaffold for a GitHub Pages deployment.

Primary path only:
- mobile-first UI
- WebGPU required
- Cornelius via `onnxruntime-web`
- dewarp via local JS perspective warp
- Milo via `onnxruntime-web`
- local gallery search in JS
- live metadata enrichment from Scryfall

No fallback modes are planned here. If the browser cannot run the main path,
the app should say so and stop.

## Product Shape

The app should feel like a handheld scanner, not a desktop dashboard.

Layout:
- dark app bar on top
- camera view on top, with small / expanded modes
- running scan list on the bottom
- one compact actions row for copy / CSV / settings
- a lightweight settings sheet instead of a dense control panel

Desktop should still render the mobile layout rather than switching to a
separate desktop UX.

## Runtime

Pipeline:

1. `getUserMedia()` captures a frame from the back camera.
2. Cornelius predicts normalized card corners.
3. Local JS dewarp warps directly into Milo's `448x448` input crop.
4. Milo emits a `128`-d embedding for the upright crop and, when enabled,
   a second embedding for a 180-degree rotated crop.
5. Browser code runs cosine search against a local embedding gallery and keeps
   the orientation with the strongest top match.
6. The winning `card_id` is enriched with static metadata and optional live
   Scryfall data.
7. The confirmed card is appended to the running list and later exported as
   text or CSV.

Runtime pieces:
- vendored `onnxruntime-web`
- `IndexedDB` for cached ONNX + catalog assets
- `fetch()` for live Scryfall lookup
- plain ES modules and static files for GitHub Pages

The browser runtime should read only local `./assets/...` files. Treat Hugging
Face as a publish-time sync source, not a live browser dependency. The same
goes for the browser runtime files: ship them with the app instead of loading
from a CDN.

## Asset Contract

Expected static assets:
- `assets/models/cornelius.onnx`
- `assets/models/milo.onnx`
- `assets/catalog/scryfall-mtg-embeddings.f16.bin`
- `assets/catalog/scryfall-mtg-card-ids.json`
- `assets/manifest.json`

Recommended shape:
- embeddings: raw float16 matrix, row-major, already L2-normalized
- card IDs: JSON string array aligned to embedding rows

For GitHub Pages, a `20-30 MB` catalog asset is acceptable. The main concern is
first-load time on phones, not whether the browser can handle it.

## Caching

Cache these in browser storage after first launch:
- Cornelius ONNX
- Milo ONNX
- gallery embedding file
- card ID table

Use `IndexedDB` with a manifest version to invalidate old assets cleanly.

## Deploy Model

The intended long-term deploy shape is:

- app source stays on `main`
- generated scanner assets are published as a GitHub release bundle
- normal Pages deploys fetch that prepared bundle from GitHub
- the HF catalog is only consulted by a separate asset refresh workflow

See:

- [ASSET_DEPLOY_PLAN.md](./ASSET_DEPLOY_PLAN.md)
- [assets.bundle.json](./assets.bundle.json)

## Local Test Loop

The generated `assets/` and `vendor/` folders are not tracked in git anymore.
For local development, regenerate them first.

Fast path:

```bash
./scripts/run_web_scanner_local.sh
```

This will:

- rebuild the local scanner bundle
- serve `examples/web_scanner` on `http://localhost:8040`

Manual path:

```bash
uv run python scripts/export_web_scanner_assets.py
cd examples/web_scanner
uv run python -m http.server 8040
```

Open `http://localhost:8040`.

## Candidate Scanner Applet API

This directory also includes an experimental, embeddable scanner applet that is
separate from the full CollectorVision demo UI:

- [`lib/collectorvision-scanner-applet.mjs`](./lib/collectorvision-scanner-applet.mjs)
- [`applet_example.html`](./applet_example.html)
- [`applet_example.js`](./applet_example.js)
- [`applet_example.css`](./applet_example.css)

The goal is a batteries-included component: add one target element, pass a JSON
configuration object, and listen for card events. It intentionally has no stock
settings screen, scan list, pricing UI, benchmark tooling, or GitHub reporting.
The Scanner Playground includes a small editable JavaScript handler that
defaults to looking up detected cards on Scryfall and appending them to a
spreadsheet-like table. The playground keeps its HTML, JavaScript, and CSS split
into small files, and its code editor uses CodeJar and Prism from jsDelivr for
lightweight syntax highlighting. It includes selectable preset handlers for a
plain lookup table, card-color page tinting, bouncing scanned-card images, and a
playful running price total, plus compact controls for match threshold and
required consecutive scans. The applet module itself does not depend on those
editor libraries or presets.

```js
import { createCollectorVisionScannerApplet } from "./lib/collectorvision-scanner-applet.mjs";

const scanner = await createCollectorVisionScannerApplet({
   target: "#collectorvision",
   matchThreshold: 0.50,
   consecutiveMatches: 2,
   scanIntervalMs: 900,
   overlay: true,
   onCardDetected(card) {
      console.log(card.cardId, card.score);
   },
});
```

This is a candidate API, not the final library package. It currently reuses the
existing scanner worker and expects the standard `./assets`, `./vendor`, and
`scanner.worker.mjs` layout served from the same static directory.

If you are testing on desktop before camera permissions or mobile WebGPU are
sorted out, use `Run Bundled Sample` from the settings sheet to exercise the
real inference path on a known card image.

For raw model latency, open Settings → Model Benchmark or visit
`http://localhost:8040/model_benchmark.html`.  WASM and WebGPU are intentionally
run as separate benchmark pages so a backend crash does not lose another
backend's report.  The benchmark runs immediately and downloads a Markdown
report that can be pasted into the canonical GitHub benchmark issue. WASM runs
a small automatic thread sweep when browser isolation allows worker threads.

## Nice To Have Later

- use `sounds/scan.wav` for successful scan confirmation
- use `sounds/pickup_mid.wav` for cards over `$0.25`
- use `sounds/pickup_high.wav` for cards over `$5`
- tiny crop thumbnail beside each confirmed scan
- card count badges for duplicates
- better offline startup messaging
